# MOS6502

A simple emulator for the MOS Technology 6502 CPU.

The goal is not to be 100% faithful to the original hardware. I just wanted to learn and have some fun.

This project was inspired by [Javidx9](https://github.com/onelonecoder)'s YouTube series on implementing a NES emulator.

The implementation of the instructions was only possible with the incredible detailed information from [mass:werk](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/).

Testing for the emulator is done using [Klaus Dormann](https://github.com/Klaus2m5)'s functional test suit for the 6502.
